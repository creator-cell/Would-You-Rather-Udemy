# Would You Rather?

This application has been done for completion of the react native nano degree program

It has been done for practicing React and Redux by developing would you rather game.

A user will be asked an question with two options. User can answer the questions and see answered questions and which are unanswered. 


The project has been bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the app with `npm start`
* access the app on http://localhost:3000/

## Backend Server

To simplify the development process, Udacity has provided a pseudo backend server for students to develop against. The [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter) contains the methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend. The required files have been incorporated into this project.

## Important

As the app works with a pseudo backend server, there is no data persistence and hence, any new questions or answers will be lost by performing a browser refresh.
